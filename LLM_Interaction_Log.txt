PROMPT #1:

Build a simple, web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two people playing on the same device. The game should behave in a way that would feel familiar to someone who has played Tic-Tac-Toe before.
Specific design and implementation decisions are intentionally left to you.

Game Expectations:
The application should allow players to:
1) interact with a visible 3×3 grid,
2) take turns,
3) reach a clear game outcome,
4) start a new game without refreshing the page.
5) give the option to restart the game at any time
.
The interface should communicate what is happening as the game progresses.

Required Extra Feature: Keyboard support. The game can be played intuitively without using a mouse.

RESPONSE: 

Implemented a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript:
- 3×3 clickable grid, alternating turns (X then O)
- Status text shows whose turn it is and announces win/draw outcomes
- Winning line is highlighted
- Restart button works at any time (no page refresh required)
- Keyboard support: Arrow keys move focus, Enter/Space places, 1–9 places directly (top-left=1), and R restarts

Files added: index.html, styles.css, script.js
README updated with run/controls instructions.
