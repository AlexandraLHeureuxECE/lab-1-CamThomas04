PROMPT #1:

Build a simple, web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two people playing on the same device. The game should behave in a way that would feel familiar to someone who has played Tic-Tac-Toe before.
Specific design and implementation decisions are intentionally left to you.

Game Expectations:
The application should allow players to:
1) interact with a visible 3×3 grid,
2) take turns,
3) reach a clear game outcome,
4) start a new game without refreshing the page.
5) give the option to restart the game at any time
.
The interface should communicate what is happening as the game progresses.

Required Extra Feature: Keyboard support. The game can be played intuitively without using a mouse.

RESPONSE: 

Implemented a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript:
- 3×3 clickable grid, alternating turns (X then O)
- Status text shows whose turn it is and announces win/draw outcomes
- Winning line is highlighted
- Restart button works at any time (no page refresh required)
- Keyboard support: Arrow keys move focus, Enter/Space places, 1–9 places directly (top-left=1), and R restarts

Files added: index.html, styles.css, script.js
README updated with run/controls instructions.


PROMPT #2:

Add a configurable dark/light mode to the app

RESPONSE:

Added a light/dark theme toggle:
- "Theme" button switches between Dark and Light modes
- Choice is saved in localStorage and restored on refresh
- If no choice is saved, the app follows the system color scheme
- Keyboard shortcut: T toggles the theme


PROMPT #3:

Move the theme button outside the Tik Tac Toe card to the top right corner of the screen, and change it to an icon button where a moon icon indicates "switch to dark mode", or, if in dark mode, the button should display a sun, indicating "switch to light mode".

RESPONSE:

Moved the theme toggle to a fixed icon button in the top-right corner of the screen:
- Light mode shows a moon icon (switch to dark)
- Dark mode shows a sun icon (switch to light)
- The button keeps the same behavior (click or press T to toggle) and updates its accessible label/title accordingly


PROMPT #4:

Now, move the Kayboard instructions. They should appear in a pop-up modal when a "Instructions" button is clicked. Make them as clear, descriptive and succinct.

RESPONSE:

Moved the keyboard instructions into an "Instructions" modal:
- Added an "Instructions" button in the game card header
- Clicking it opens a pop-up dialog with concise gameplay + keyboard controls
- The dialog can be closed via Close button, clicking outside, or Esc


PROMPT #5:

Change how the keyboard buttons 1-9 behave. Instead of placing direclty into those cells, it should just highlight them and the enter/space key is still needed to place in that cell. This means the numbers and the arrow keys are both simply ways of moving the cursor, the enter/space key is the only way to actually place using the keyboard. Update the instructions accordingly

RESPONSE:

Updated keyboard number-key behavior:
- `1`–`9` now only moves focus to the selected square (no placement)
- Enter/Space remains the only keyboard way to place a mark (arrow keys + numbers just move the cursor)
- Updated the Instructions modal and README to match
